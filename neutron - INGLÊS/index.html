            <p>The history of rocket development goes back thousands of years, but it was in the 20th century that rocket technology began to develop rapidly, driven primarily by military interest and space exploration. Here is a summary of important milestones and major companies involved in rocket development.</p>
            <p>Below are examples of two companies that operate in the Rockets area:</p>
            <li>NASA: The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was founded in 1958 by the United States to lead civilian space exploration. NASA developed and operated a number of rockets, including the Saturn V rocket that took astronauts to the Moon during the Apollo Program.</li>
            <li>SpaceX: Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, SpaceX is one of the most prominent companies in the rocket industry today. It has developed and launched several rockets, including the Falcon 1, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. SpaceX is known for its efforts to reduce the cost of space launches and its goal to colonize Mars.</li>

            <h2>WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF ROCKETS AND THEIR USE FOR SOCIETY?</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg">
              <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/34/13/71/341371f9064dd552f366ec29b5fc483c.jpg" width="890">

            <p>Rockets serve many purposes and are extremely useful to society in many areas. Here are some of the main uses and benefits of rockets:</p>
            <li>Space Exploration: Rockets are essential for space exploration. They are used to launch artificial satellites, space probes and telescopes to study the universe, investigate other planets and moons, obtain images and scientific data, perform experiments in microgravity and expand our knowledge of the cosmos.</li>
            <li>Communication: Most global communications rely on communications satellites, which are launched into orbit using rockets. These satellites provide telephone services, television broadcasting, internet, GPS navigation and many other communication services that are essential in modern society.</li>
            <li>Earth Observation: Rockets are used to launch Earth observation satellites that provide valuable information about our planet. These satellites collect climate data, monitor natural disasters, study ecosystem health, monitor agriculture, and provide information for urban planning and environmental monitoring.</li>
            <p>In addition to these uses, rockets also have significant economic impacts, boosting space industries, spurring technological innovation and creating jobs across multiple industries.</p>

            <h2>SMART PROJECT: Neutron</h2>
            <div class="fakeimg">
              <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/15/68/30/156830c09194a2411098c6e8bf33b7eb.jpg" width="890">
            </div>
            <li>Specific: The purpose of the rocket design must be clearly and specifically defined. For example, the project might aim to launch a specific payload into low Earth orbit or send a space exploration mission to a specific planet.</li>
            <li>Measurable: It is important that the project has measurable criteria to evaluate its success. For example, the rocket can be evaluated in terms of payload capacity, engine performance, fuel efficiency or launch success rate.</li>
            <li>Achievable: The rocket design must be realistic and achievable with available resources and technologies. The objectives must be within the technical and financial possibilities of the team or company responsible for the project.</li>
            <li>Relevant: The rocket design must be relevant to the overall goals and objectives of the team or company. It must be aligned with the strategic objectives, market needs and interests of the organization or customers involved.
            </li>
            <li>Time-bound: The rocket project must have a definite deadline for completion. Establishing a timeline helps ensure that the project progresses in a timely manner and that resources are allocated appropriately.
            </li>
            <li>By following the SMART principle, project teams can set clear and achievable goals for their rocket projects, increasing the chances of success and efficiency along the way.
